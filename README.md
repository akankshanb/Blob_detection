# Blob_detection

The objective of this project is to implement a Laplacian blob detector by implementing the entire algorithm independently without built-in functions used for core components.

<head><b>Algorithm outline:</b></head>

‚Ä¢ Generate a Laplacian of Gaussian filter.</br>
‚Ä¢ Build a Laplacian scale space, starting with some initial scale and going for n iterations:</br>
  Filter image with scale-normalized Laplacian at current scale.</br>
  Save square of Laplacian response for current level of scale space. o Increase scale by a factor ùëò.</br>
‚Ä¢ Perform non-maximum suppression in scale space.</br>
‚Ä¢ Display resulting circles at their characteristic scales.</br>
